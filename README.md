# Temporal autocorrelation increases temperature-driven extinction risk
Environments are becoming increasingly autocorrelated as global climate change progresses, leading to the intensification of deadly events like heatwaves and droughts. Theory shows that temporally autocorrelated environments generate a higher risk of population extinction; however, little work has been done to incorporate temporal autocorrelation into thermal performance-based projections of extinction risk. Here, we pair stochastic simulation models of population dynamics with systematically generated temperature time series to demonstrate when higher levels of autocorrelation generate greater extinction risk. We show that autocorrelation is a significant mediator of risk under stressful temperature regimes, with important ramifications for forecasting temperature-driven extinctions in ectothermic organisms, and validate our predictions with a factorial experiment in microcosms of the single-celled protist Paramecium caudatum. Taken together, these results provide the foundation for predicting which species and environments face the greatest risks under increasing autocorrelation.

### Methods figures
This code generates Fig 1 and 2 from the 'Materials & Methods' section. It can also be used to generate new temperature time series with specified thermal distributions and levels of autocorrelation. Before recreating the figures in the paper, you will need to download 'PcaudatumTPCdata.csv'.
